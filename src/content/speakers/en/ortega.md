**Tomas Ortega** is a team member at **Mushroom Protocol**, a platform that democratizes biotech investment in Latin America. For the past 20 years, investment in R&D—especially in biotechnology—has remained stagnant in Latin America, and Mushroom Protocol is breaking down these barriers.

The platform uses blockchain to tokenize two key asset classes:
- **Intellectual Property** from early-stage research
- **Equity** in biotech startups

This allows investors worldwide to participate in the ownership of cutting-edge biotechnologies from their earliest stages, transforming the industry by providing affordable, simple, and liquid access to biotech opportunities.
