**Federico Weill** is a biochemist with a PhD in Immunology and a proven track record at the crossroads of science, technology, and decentralized innovation. During his PhD research, he discovered a probiotic-derived molecule that reduces the damaging effects of solar radiation on skin cancer (PubMed). In parallel, he worked for over 15 years as a consultant and researcher in the food industry. 

Over the past decade, Federico has focused on data science and software development through his work at Line64. This unique combination of scientific and technical skills led him to co-found **Mizu/Clood**, a company that merged science and technology to create functional, health-focused food products, which was successfully acquired in 2023. 

In 2021, Federico co-founded **TxPipe**, a technology company dedicated to building core infrastructure for Web3. Through tools like **Demeter.run**, TxPipe supports the Cardano ecosystem by enabling developers and enterprises to build decentralized applications and blockchain services more efficiently and securely.
