**The world is a better place when we act as a group.**

**A big brain is activated when massive groups of people collaborate around a common goal, and contribute to realize that goal.**

**The purpose of collaborating is contributing. Without decisive action funneled through contribution, collaboration has no reason to live.**

**Sebastian Pabon** is the visionary behind **Andamio**, a platform that facilitates collaboration and contribution of massive groups of people in the framework of big projects. 

**When the collective intelligence activated by groups of people turns on, the project improves its performance, and in doing so, the communities get their share of the benefits, in a project-people virtuous circle that feeds back positively in favor of the project and in favor of the communities.**

**The facilitation of collective intelligence should not be underestimated: they are the basis of global liquid markets, the reason why companies like Google are currently focusing their toolset to facilitate it, the reason why multinational companies like Syngenta or FC Barcelona (Andamio customers) are exploring it as a competitive advantage to engage their niche markets (farmers and fans).**

Sebastian's work at Andamio demonstrates how tokenized communities can transform the way organizations engage with their stakeholders, creating sustainable ecosystems where collaboration drives innovation and shared value creation.
