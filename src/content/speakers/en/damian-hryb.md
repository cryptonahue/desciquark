Damián Hryb is a Cardano developer since 2021 and the founder of **CardanoTree**, the first fully on-chain evolutive generative art project on Cardano, where digital trees live and grow independently. This creative endeavor merges blockchain technology, visual art, and environmental consciousness in a groundbreaking way. 

He has been recognized in several **Cardano Hackathons** for his innovative work and technical contributions. Damián was also a key developer in the **first edition of Veritree's Initial Tree Offering (ITO)** — a milestone project that resulted in planting real trees through the **Cardano Forest** initiative. 

Today, he continues developing with next-generation tools like **Aiken**.
